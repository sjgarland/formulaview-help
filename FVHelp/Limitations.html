  <p>
    The current release of Formula View has the following limitations.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Web access required</h4>

  <p>
    Formula View, like all add-ins for Office 365, can only be used when connected to the web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The <a href="MathView.html">math view</a> uses the web-based typesetting
    service provided by <a href="http://mathjax.org">MathJax.org</a>.
    Hence the math view is available only if that service is available.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Notations in formulas</h4>
  
  <p>
    Formula View does not recognize R1C1 notations for references.
  </p><p>
    Formula View treats identifiers such as <code>ABCD2</code> and <code>A1234567</code> as
    references to cells, rather than as user-defined names, even though they exceed Excel's limits on the
    maximum numbers of rows and columns in a spreadsheet.
  </p><p>
    Formula View does not recognize structured references, such as <code>Inventory[InStock]</code>,
    to columns in tables.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Array expressions</h4>
  
  <p>
    Formula View may display incorrect values for expressions that occur in array formulas or
    in functions like <code>SUMPRODUCT</code>, which treat their arguments as array formulas.
  </p>

  <h4>Volatile functions</h4>

  <p>
    Some functions in Excel are <em>volatile</em> in that they can produce different results
    each time they are evaluated.  For example, <code>RND</code> and <code>RNDBETWEEN</code>
    deliberately produce different (and unpredictable) values.  The functions <code>NOW</code>,
    <code>TODAY</code>, <code>OFFSET</code>, and <code>INDIRECT</code> are also volatile, as
    are <code>INFO</code>, <code>CELL</code>, and <code>SUMIF</code> for certain arguments.
    Excel recommends using volatile functions sparingly.
  </p><p>
    Because Formula View uses Excel to compute values for display in the tree view, it can
    change the value of the viewed formula.  Furthermore, the value it shows for
    a volatile function in the tree view may be inconsistent with the values it shows for
    elements above that function.  (This is a bug that may be fixed in a future release.)
  </p>

  <h4>Limitations imposed by Excel for the web</h4>

  <p>
    Excel for the web does not allow the width of the Formula View pane to be increased.  Neither does
    it allow the pane to be undocked.
