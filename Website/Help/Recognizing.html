      Use Case: Recognizing a Formula
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Formulas in spreadsheets can be hard to understand.  Do you recognize the one in cell
      <code>E6</code>?
    </p>
    
    <div class="figure">
      <img src="Images/Recognizing/E6.png" alt="Formula in cell E6">
      <span class="caption">A formula in cell E6</span>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Let's ask Formula Forge for help.  Select cell <code>E6</code> and click the
      <code>Get Formula</code> button on Excel's <code>Formulas</code> ribbon to
      see a pane with three views of the formula in cell <code>E6</code>.
      The math view, which shows the formula as it might be typeset in a book, is
      particularly informative: it reveals that this formula
      is none other than the familiar quadratic formula taught in high school algebra.
    </p>
    
    <div class="figure">
      <img src="Images/Recognizing/Views.png" alt="Formula Forge pane">
      <span class="caption">The <code>Formula Forge</code> pane</span>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Along with the math view are a text view and a tree view. The 
      <code>Formula Forge </code> pane is not wide enough to display
      the entire tree view, so we click its left edge and drag it left to
      widen the pane.
    </p>
    
    <div class="figure">
      <img src="Images/Recognizing/TreeView.png" alt="The tree view">
      <span class="caption">The widened tree view</span>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Now we can see the entire tree view.  This view displays the elements
      that comprise the formula, according to the order in which they are
      evaluated, from the bottom up.  The elements at the bottom are constants
      or references, and the elements higher up correspond to operators
      or functions.  
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand where an element in the tree view occurs in the entire formula,
      we can click that element to highlight it in all views.  To find the smallest
      element in the tree view that contains a symbol in either the text view or
      the math view, we can click that symbol to highlight the containing element
      in all views.  Formula Forge automatically synchronizes all three views when
      an action occurs in any one of those views.
    </p>
