        <h1>Overview</h1>
        
        <p>
            Formula Forge, by Stage One Software, seeks to reduce the tremendous costs incurred
            by spreadsheet errors, which are all too prevalent in business.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Sources of Spreadsheet Errors</h2>
        
        <p>
            There are many sources for errors, including poor development practices, formulas
            improperly copied from one cell to another, and errors in the text of a formula.
            Generally speaking, these errors can be categorized as <em>practice errors</em>,
            <em>structural errors</em>, and <em>computational errors</em>.  Formula Forge is
            designed to reduce errors in the third category.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Practice Errors</h3>
        
        <p>
            Practice errors result from failing to implement and/or adequately follow best
            practices such as how to handle constants.  Best practice dictates putting constants
            in cells where they can be readily identified and referenced. Then, if a constant
            must be changed, only one cell has to be edited, not the many cells that contain
            the constant as a literal. Organizations that want to reduce or eliminate practice
            errors often utilize the services of <em>training companies</em> that provide best
            practices education.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Structural Errors</h3>
        
        <p>
            Structural errors involve relationships among cells in a spreadsheet. A typical
            error occurs after a formula is replicated by copying it into a range of
            rows and/or columns. The copies of the formula are structurally the same,
            differing only in the relative references they contain. An error can occur,
            however, if one cell in the range is changed in a way that breaks the relationship.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Many structural errors can be found by <em>spreadsheet auditing software</em>.
            Such software can take the form of a plugin or standalone program that reads and
            analyzes a spreadsheet to produce a report of structural inconsistencies as well
            as specific practice errors.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Computational Errors</h3>
        
        <p>
            Computational errors arise from several common kinds of mistakes in formulas.
        </p>

        <h4>Parenthesis Errors</h4>
        
        <p>
            A formula's value depends on the order in which Excel evaluates its operations.
            Parentheses control this order, but the arrangement and grouping of these slim
            slim characters can be hard to see.  Problems arise particularly when a formula
            contains many parentheses, which make it difficult to ascertain the evaluation
            order by simple visual examination.  Other problems can while editing a formula:
            Excel may refuse to save the formula because its parentheses are not balanced,
            or it may save a faulty formula if its parentheses have been inserted incorrectly.
            Although Excel often suggests how to fix parenthesis errors, it can be hard to see if
            its suggestions are appropriate or what the correction should be.
        </p>
        

        <h4>Evaluation Errors</h4>

        <p>
            Evaluation errors cause formulas to produce the wrong result.  For example,
            Excel evaluates <code>-X1^2</code> by computing <code>-X1</code> first and
            then squaring the result, contrary to ordinary mathematical and programming
            language conventions, which square X1 first.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Logic Errors</h4>
        
        <p>
            Complicated formulas often use branching functions, such as <code>IF</code>
            and <code>CHOOSE</code>.  An error can occur if such a function chooses the
            wrong branch for conditional evaluation.  The likelihood of such an error
            increases when these functions are nested.
        </p>

        <h4>Subexpression Errors</h4>
        
        <p>
            A complicated formula often often contains many subexpressions, which in turn
            may contain still other subexpressions.  If the entire formula has the
            wrong value, the problem may be caused by an incorrect subexpression. Finding
            that subexpression can be very difficult.  Pernicious and hard-to-find latent
            error often occur in unused branches of a conditional function.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Cloning Errors</h4>
        
        <p>
            Sometimes a formula contains the same subexpression multiple times. If the
            subexpression isn’t copied exactly, it can introduce an error.  Subtle changes
            in how characters are arranged can be difficult to see, and repetitive expressions
            in Excel’s character-based formula bar make a formula difficult to read.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Formula Forge: Stage One Software’s Remedy</h2>
        
        <p>
            To date, there has been only limited help for finding and fixing computational
            errors, mainly on Excel’s Formulas ribbon and in its help files. Stage One
            Software remedies this defect by offering Formula Forge, the first tool
            specifically designed to eliminate computational errors. Formula Forge integrates
            directly into Excel to provide multiple views of formulas that clarify their
            meaning and their evaluation.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Its <em>text view</em> shows a formula’s text as it appears in Excel’s
                formula bar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Its <em>math view</em> shows a formula as it would be typeset
                in a book on mathematics, making it much easier to read.
            </li>
            <li>
                Its <em>tree view</em> contains a hierarchical diagram like an organization
                chart, showing how Excel decomposes a formula into its constituent elements,
                along with values for all its elements.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Users can highlight an element they wish to examine in any view.  Formula Forge
            automatically highlights that element in the other views, enabling users to see
            where they are.  Users can also collapse elements (to hide irrelevant detail and
            focus their attention elsewhere) and then re-expand these elements to examine
            them more closely.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A forthcoming release of Formula Forge will provide a drag-and-drop editor.
            With it, users can construct, debug and modify formulas easily and accurately
            using simple building blocks, without ever again having to worry about parentheses.
