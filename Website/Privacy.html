        <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
        
        <p>Last modified: April 13, 2020</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Stage One Software ("<strong>We</strong>") respects your privacy and is committed to
            protecting it through our compliance with this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding
            your information and how our Formula Forge add-in to Microsoft Excel uses that information.
            If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with,
            or use Formula Forge.  By downloading, registering with, or using
            it, you agree to this privacy policy.  This policy may change from time to time.
            Your continued use of Formula Forge after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those
            changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
        </p>
        <h2>Information collection and use</h2>
        <p>
            This website and Formula Forge does not collect or store any private or personal information from you or your device.
        </p>
        <h2>Information transmission</h2>
        <p>
            Formula Forge does not transmit any personal or private information other than to ensure that you
            have a valid license to use it.  For this purpose, we may eventually use Microsoft's AppSource License Verification
            Web Service to validate an add-in license token provided to us by Excel.
            For more information about add-in licensing, see Microsoft's descriptions of
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/store/how-licenses-work">how licenses work</a>
            and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/store/add-in-license-schema">license tokens</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-party information collection</h2>
        <p>
            Except for the AppSource License Verification Web Service, we do not supply any third party
            service with any information.
        </p>
        <h2>Application hosting</h2>
        <p>
            We do not supply our hosting provider, Little Oak, with any personal or private user
            information.  We encourage you to read 
            <a href="https://www.littleoak.net/policies/">Little Oak's legal information</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>
            Both this website and Formula Forge use Google Analytics to analyze user activity, and
            we use reports from Google to improve the services we provide.  Google Analytics uses
            <em>cookies</em> (small text files, stored by your browser) to collect information
            about users, such the browser and server they are using as well as their language preference,
            country setting, and IP address.  These cookies do not contain any personal data. 
            If you want to prevent Google Analytics from using your data, you can
            install its add-on to your browser, available at
            <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Children under the age of 13</h2>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  If we learn we have
            collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental
            consent, we will delete that information.  If you believe we might have any information from or
            about a child under 13, please contact us.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our privacy policy from time to time.  If we make material changes to how we
            treat our users' personal information, we will post the new privacy policy on this page.
            The date on which this privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of this page.
        </p>
