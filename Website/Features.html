        <p>
            Formula Forge adds a task pane to Excel, and it uses this pane to present
            three synchronized views of a formula that clarity its meaning and its evaluation.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Text view</em> &#8211; the formula as it appears in Excel's
                formula bar
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Math view</em> &#8211; the formula typeset to aid recognition
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Tree view</em> &#8211; a structural view to
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        organize subexpressions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        display their values
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        expand and collapse their display
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Synchronized views help users see the structure of their formulas and allow them
            to concentrate on portions of particular interest.  Coordinated highlighting
            links subexpressions across the views.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can collapse parts of a formula in the tree view to focus
            their attention on other parts, and they can substitute ellipses (...)
            or values in the math and text views for the collapsed parts. 
            These capabilities let user simplify parts of a formula, thereby making
            it easier to understand.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Work inside formulas</h2>
        
        <p>
            When configured for editing, Formula Forge's task pane provides a palette of
            items that can be dragged and dropped into the tree view.
            It also allows
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Moving elements within a formula
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating new elements from items in a palette
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating and using named elements called <em>scraps</em>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="Images/Editing.jpg" alt="Formula Forge Editor"/>
            <span class="caption">The Formula Forge editor</span>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Parenthesis-free Editing</h3>
        
        <p>
            Formula Forge allows users to edit without worrying about the parentheses,
            which Excel requires to specify the order of computation. With Formula Forge,
            this order is determined by the hierarchical diagram in the tree view.
            As a result, users get the order right, without ever again having to worry
            about parentheses.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Easy Editing</h3>
        
        <p>
            Editing is easy with drag and drop. With the aid of the palette, users can
            change the elements in a formula or create a new formula from scratch.
            <em>Scraps</em> let users analyze and debug one element at a time.
            They can create a scrap for any element using drag and drop, and they can display the
            scrap and edit it in the simultaneous views as if it were the entire formula.
            They can also drag any scrap into the tree view to incorporate it into a formula.
            That way, they can construct, debug, and assemble building blocks for a formula easily,
            accurately, and productively.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Further Aid to Comprehension</h3>
        
        <p>
            The Formula Forge pane provides an aid to comprehension beyond the ability to
            collapse and expand subexpressions: it lets users assign local names, called
            <em>aliases</em>, to scraps and to substitute the alias for the text of the
            scrap wherever it occurs. This capability provides additional clarity.
