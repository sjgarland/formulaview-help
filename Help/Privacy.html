    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        Stage One Software ("<strong>We</strong>") respects your privacy and are committed to
        protecting it through our compliance with this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding
        your information and how this add-in to Microsoft Excel uses that information.
        If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with,
        or use this add-in.  By downloading, registering with, or using
        this add-in, you agree to this privacy policy.  This policy may change from time to time.
        Your continued use of this add-in after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those
        changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.
    </p>
    <h4>Information collection and use</h4>
    <p>
        This add-in does not collect or store any private or personal information from you or your device.
    </p>
    <h4>Information transmission</h4>
    <p>
        This add-in does not transmit any personal or private information other than to ensure that you
        have a valid license to use it.  For this purpose, we use Microsoft's AppSource License Verification
        Web Service to validate an add-in license token provided to us by Excel.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information about add-in licensing, see Microsoft's descriptions of
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/store/how-licenses-work">how licenses work</a>
        and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/store/add-in-license-schema">license tokens</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Third-party information collection</h4>
    <p>
        Except for the AppSource License Verification Web Service, we do not supply any third party
        service with any information.
    </p>
    <h4>Application hosting</h4>
    <p>
        We use Microsoft Azure to host our application.  While we do not supply our hosting provider
        with any personal or private user information, it is possible that hosting companies collect
        their own data.  We encourage you to read <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal">Microsoft's legal information</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Children under the age of 13</h4>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  If we learn we have
        collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental
        consent, we will delete that information.  If you believe we might have any information from or
        about a child under 13, please contact us.
    </p>
    <h4>Changes to our privacy policy</h4>
    <p>
        We may update our privacy policy from time to time.  If we make material changes to how we
        treat our users' personal information, we will post the new privacy policy on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
        The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page.
        You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address
        for you and for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.
    </p>
