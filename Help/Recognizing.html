    Formulas in spreadsheets can be hard to understand.  Do you recognize the one in cell
    <code>E6</code>?
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <img src="Images/Recognizing/E6.png" alt="Formula in cell E6">
    <span class="caption">A formula in cell E6</span>
  </div>

  <p>
    Let's ask Formula Forge for help.  Select cell <code>E6</code>, click
    <code>Formula View</code> on Excel's ribbon, and then click <code>Get</code>
    to have Excel display a pane containing three views of the formula in cell
    <code>E6</code>.  The math view, which shows the formula as it might be
    typeset in a book, is particularly informative: it shows that the formula
    in cell <code>E6</code> is none other than the familiar quadratic formula
    taught in high school algebra.
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <img src="Images/Recognizing/Views.png" alt="Formula View pane">
    <span class="caption">The Formula View pane</span>
  </div>

  <p>
    Along with the math view are a text view and a tree view. The 
    <code>Formula View </code> pane is not wide enough to display
    the entire tree view, so we click its left edge and drag it left to
    widen the pane.
  </p>

  <div class="figure">
    <img src="Images/Recognizing/TreeView.png" alt="The tree view">
    <span class="caption">The widened tree view</span>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Now we can see the entire tree view.  This view displays the elements
    that comprise the formula, according to the order in which they are
    evaluated, from the bottom up.  The bottom elements 
    are constants or references, and upper elements correspond to operators
    or functions.  
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand where an element in the tree view occurs in the entire formula,
    we can click that element to highlight it in all views.  To find the smallest
    element in the tree view that contains a symbol in either the text view or
    the math view, we can click that symbol to highlight the containing element
    in all views.  Formula Forge automatically synchronizes all three views when
    an action occurs in any one of those views.
