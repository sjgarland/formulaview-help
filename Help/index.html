        Formula View helps users of Microsoft Excel&reg; understand complicated formulas
        by presenting multiple views that clarify their meaning and structure.  Its
        forthcoming extension, Formula Forge, will make it easier to create and modify
        formulas using intuitive drag-and-drop graphics instead of error-prone text
        entry.

            The <a href="TextView.html">text view</a> shows the text of a formula, as
            it appears in Excel's formula bar.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <a href="MathView.html">math view</a> shows a mathematically
            typeset, easier to read version of the formula.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <a href="TreeView.html">tree view</a> shows how Excel decomposes a
            formula into simpler elements.  
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Excel makes extensive use of parentheses, both to surround function
        arguments and to constrain the evaluation order.  Without parentheses
        in a formula like <code>(A1+A2)/(2*SQRT(B1))</code>, Excel would not know
        to compute the numerator <code>A1+A2</code> and the denominator 
        <code>2*SQRT(B1)</code> before it computed their quotient.  However, so many
        parentheses in formulas can make them hard to read.
    </p><p>
        When installed in Excel, Formula View makes formulas much easier to read.
        It adds a <code>View</code> button to Excel's <code>Formulas</code> ribbon.
        Clicking that button causes Formula View to show a math and tree view,
        uncluttered by parentheses, in addition to the text view for the formula
        in the selected cell.

        Formula View allows users to <a href="Navigation.html">select</a> an
        element in a formula for attention by clicking it in any of its three views.
        It also allows users to <a href="Abbreviations.html">collapse and expand</a>
        elements to suppress or reveal detail, and it synchronizes all three
        views so that actions in any one view are reflected automatically in the others.
