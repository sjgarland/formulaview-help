  <h2>Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>General questions</h3>
  
<dl>
    <dt>
        How long will Formula Forge be available for free?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Honestly, we don't know.  We reserve the right to charge or require licenses
        for its use, but will give fair notice if we choose to do so.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Can I use Formula Forge offline?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Unfortunately not.  Formula Forge, like all add-ins for Office 365,
        can be used only when connected to the web.  Furthermore, the
        <a href="MathView.html">math view</a> uses a web-based typesetting
        service provided by <a href="http://mathjax.org">MathJax.org</a>.
        Hence it is available only when it can reach the MathJax site.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Why doesn't Formula Forge work in Excel for the web with my browser?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Formula Forge does not work with Internet Explorer after Release 11.657, which fails
        to typeset the math view and fails to draw boxes in the tree view that are wide
        enough to contain symbols such as <code>SQRT</code>.  Please follow Microsoft's
        recommendation to use Edge instead of Internet Explorer: it is faster and has better
        features.  If you are having problems with another browser, please let us know.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Why doesn't Formula Forge recognize my formula?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Formula Forge does not recognize <code>R1C1</code> notations for references.  Neither
        does it recognize structured references, such as <code>Inventory[InStock]</code>,
        to columns in tables.  This may change in a future release.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Can Formula Forge misinterpret my formula?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Unfortunately, yes.  Formula Forge treats identifiers such as <code>ABCD2</code>
        and <code>A1234567</code> as references to cells, not as user-defined names,
        even though they exceed Excel's limits on the maximum numbers of rows and columns
        in a spreadsheet.  Please let us know if it gets anything else wrong.
    </dd>

<h3>Questions about values in the tree view</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>
        Why won't Formula Forge show me values in the tree view?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Formula Forge will not compute values for the elements in your formula if it
        is on a protected worksheet.  To ensure accuracy, Formula Forge temporarily
        writes elements in your formula into the cell from which it came, and it gets their values from Excel.
        It cannot do this if your worksheet is protected.  Unprotect the sheet if you want
        to see values.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        But my worksheet isn't protected and I still can't see values in the tree view!
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Formula Forge also refuses to compute values for a formula on a protected
        workbook.  It hides its computation of values by displaying a new
        sheet named <code>Formula Forge at work</code>, and it cannot create
        that sheet if your workbook is protected.  Unprotect the workbook if you want to see values.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Why does Formula Forge change the value of my formula?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        As just noted, Formula Forge temporarily copies elements
        in your formula into its cell to get their values from Excel.  This can change
        the value of your formula if it contains a <em>volatile</em> function, which
        generally produces a different result when it is re-evaluated.  For example, <code>RND</code>
        deliberately produces different (and unpredictable) values.  The functions <code>NOW</code>,
        <code>TODAY</code>, <code>OFFSET</code>, <code>INDIRECT</code>, and 
        <code>RNDBETWEEN</code> are also volatile, as are <code>INFO</code>, <code>CELL</code>,
        and <code>SUMIF</code> for certain arguments.  Excel recommends using volatile functions sparingly.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Why does Excel show inconsistent values in the tree view?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Formula Forge uses Excel repeatedly to compute values for all elements in a formula like
        <code>RND()+1</code>.  In response, Excel produces one random value for <code>RND()</code>
        by itself and another for it in <code>RND()+1</code>.  These are highly unlikely to
        differ by exactly <code>1</code>.  A future release of Formula Forge may evaluate volatile
        functions differently.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        When else might Formula Forge show incorrect values in the tree view?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Formula Forge does not update the values in the tree view if you make changes in your
        spreadsheet.  It may also show incorrect values for expressions in array formulas or
        in functions like <code>SUMPRODUCT</code>, which treat their arguments as array formulas.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Can anything else go wrong if I ask Formula Forge to show values in the tree view?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        You should use Formula Forge with caution with the online version of Excel,
        which stores spreadsheets on OneDrive and automatically saves all changes.
        As a result, the temporary changes Formula Forge makes in your spreadsheet as
        it computes values will be visible on OneDrive.  Likewise, you should use
        Formula Forge with caution with desktop versions of Excel when <code>AutoSave</code>
        is on.
