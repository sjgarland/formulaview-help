    Long formulas can be hard to read.  Consider, for example, a spreadsheet that uses
    a formula such as this to compute a letter grade for students scoring above average
    on an exam.
  </p>
  <p class="center">
    <code>IF(B2>=90,"A",IF(B2>=80,"B","C"))&IF(OR(B2=100,MOD(B2,10)>7),"+",IF(MOD(B2,10)<3,"-",""))</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    It's hard to tell which parentheses match up in a formula this long,
    and it's hard to understand what's going on in one part of the formula when
    details in another part overwhelm what we want to see there.  Furthermore,
    a formula of this size does not fit tidily into the Formula View pane.
  </p>

    We can pan around in the Formula View using scrollbars (which unfortunately are somewhat
    elusive in Excel for Windows).  We can also widen the Formula View pane (in Excel for
    Windows or the Mac) by hovering the cursor over its left edge and dragging it left, but the pane may
    still be too narrow.  And, in Excel for Windows, we can make the Formula View pane even
    wider by dragging its top edge left to undock the pane and then resizing the
    undocked pane by dragging its edges outward.  But even that may not be wide enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, the tree view gives us another way to see just what we want.  We can suppress
    details associated with selected elements in the view by clicking the triangular
    collapse/expand icons just below those elements, thereby giving us a clearer view of the remaining
    elements.  Formula View automatically synchronizes the text and math views with
    the tree view, replacing collapsed elements in those views with ellipses (...). 
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    By collapsing the element in our formula that computes a letter grade, <code>A</code>
    through <code>C</code>, we see more clearly the <code>IF</code>element for generating
    a plus or minus sign to follow the letter.  If we wish to focus attention on the element
    that computes the letter grade, we can expand it by clicking its triangular
    collapse/expand icon (indicated by the cursor) and collapsing the tree below the other
    <code>IF</code> element.
